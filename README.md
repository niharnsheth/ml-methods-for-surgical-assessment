# Machine Learing methods for Surgical Assessment
Respository contains some machine learning models developed for classifying surgical skills (Novice, Intermediate and Expert) from surgical performance datasets.

## Datasets
Currently there are two datasets that are added to the repository.
1. JIGSAW dataset -  publically available dataset collected from surgical robot DaVinci
2. Neonatology Emergencey Procedures - Contains surgical instrument motion data for two emergency procedures: Pericariocentesis and Thoracentesis
